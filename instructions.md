Please create a simple category page (you can find an example here: https://beautinow.com/collections/new-arrivals/). Please use the data stored in a JSON file attached in the zip file. Please select JavaScript framework you feel most comfortable in (we are using SvelteKit with Svelte 5 and Tailwind CSS to build our new website, utilizing those tools would be a bonus but it is not a requirement). The category page should be paginated with between 16-25 items per page  and there should be a navigation bar on the bottom of the page, adding features such as sorting, filtering or search bar will be consider a significant advantage. 

The overall assessment will be based on: 
1. Visual quality of the page and its scalability on different device types.
2. Website Lighthouse score and the overall speed
3. The quality of the submitted code (readability, comments etc.)
